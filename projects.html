                                            <p>Games are often seen in a negative light by parents and elderly people for impacting the children's health, especially due to lack of mobility and overusage of eyes looking at the screen for a long time. When the 
                                                games that require movement, such as Pokémon, which involves catching the game character in the real world, appear, the negative opinions of the public have never changed due to accidents that occur.</p>
                                            <p>I believe that games like Pokémon should not be severely criticized since they are a much healthier option than normal games due to the player's physical participation. Lacking the ability to find ways to prevent 
                                                the accidents is the only gap I believe I could fill in terms of technology. My aim of contribution is to set up upgraded AI/ML systems in such a game to detect the real world and set alarms when the user invades
                                                 the danger zones.</p>
                                            <p>I am now on my way to implementing my goal for the society by learning the programming languages like C++, doing tutorial projects like 'Lottery Winner' and 'Rolls of Dice' as a start-up as well as HTML/CSS, C# and 
                                                Java for building structures and visuals. I also learn game development from YouTube and other learning platforms as a specific study and join coding events online to get others' ideas.</p>
